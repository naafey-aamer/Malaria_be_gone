# Malaria_be_gone
Malaria classification from the thin blood smear slide images of segmented cells.

This project focuses on the classification of malaria-infected and uninfected cells using Deep Learning. The project uses the Malaria dataset from TensorFlow Datasets, which consists of microscopic cell images. The goal was to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately classify the cells.
